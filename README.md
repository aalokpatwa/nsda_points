# nsda_points
## Aalok Patwa 2020

[The National Speech and Debate Association](speechanddebate.org) allocates points to competitors for their performance at tournaments. However, there does not exist a way to see a precise breakdown of a competitor's points across the different events they compete in.

This program categorizes a competitor's NSDA points into events. 

Input: the csv file of a competitor's point entries, found on their NSDA account profile. 

Output: a pandas DataFrame of their point allocations across their events.
