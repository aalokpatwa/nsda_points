# NSDA Points Categorization
## Aalok Patwa 2020

[The National Speech and Debate Association](https://speechanddebate.org) allocates points to competitors for their performance at tournaments. However, there does not exist a way to see a precise breakdown of a competitor's points **across the different events they compete in**.

This program categorizes a competitor's NSDA points into events. 

Input: the csv file of a competitor's point entries, found on their NSDA account profile. 

Output: a csv file of a competitor's points, broken down by event.
